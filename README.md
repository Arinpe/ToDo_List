# Todo_list

In this project, I built a simple Todo App using Webpack and ES6 by dynamically creating a majority of the DOM elements. Local storage was used to persist data across the user's session. It is a web application that helps you organize your task according to projects.

- DOM Manipulation with JavaScript
- LocalStorage
